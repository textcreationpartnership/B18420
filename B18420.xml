            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>My heart doth tremble, and my hand doth shake,</l>

                  <l>For to declare what here I have begun</l>
                  <l>enough to melt a heart as hard as stone:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To sée how people take delight in Sin,</l>
                  <l>and for to mend their lives will not begin,</l>
                  <l>Vntil Gods Iudgments do them overtake,</l>
                  <l>they never strive their Sins for to forsake.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>We rather seek to run in Sin the more,</l>
                  <l>while Satan séekes our Souls for to devour;</l>
                  <l>Let's strive in time to break his subtil snare,</l>
                  <l>and of our Souls and Bodies have a care.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To see how many they do swear and curse,</l>
                  <l>surely they think not of a God so just,</l>
                  <l>That hears or sees, their actions that are done;</l>
                  <l>yes, at the last, besure he will strike home.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>As for example now in <hi>Stafford-Shire,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>there's a sad Iudgement, as it doth appear</l>
                  <l>On forsworn wretches: there a man doth ly</l>
                  <l>in woful state and grievous misery.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He stole a Bible as it is well known,</l>
                  <l>and being taxt, the same he did disown:</l>
                  <l>He pray'd unto God his hands might Rot,</l>
                  <l>and so a Iudgment on himself he brought.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In a small time he had his full desire,</l>
                  <l>and what he of the Lord did then require,</l>
                  <l>His hand-wrists rot away most wofully:</l>
                  <l>his hands are dead and black as black may be.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The joynts of's knees do rot in the same sort,</l>
                  <l>as several hundred people can report,</l>
                  <l>That daily goes to see and take a view,</l>
                  <l>and witness can, the same for to be true.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Vpon the ground he stinks, as he doth lie,</l>
                  <l>none can endure for to stand him nigh:</l>
                  <l>Lord grant that each good Christian may take care,</l>
                  <l>how they themselves, so falsly do forswear.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He doth declare, and also doth confess,</l>
                  <l>it's Gods just Iudgment for his wickedness,</l>
                  <l>For stealing of this holy Bible book</l>
                  <l>and following Sin, and so Gods law's forsook.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But now alas within this world there's few,</l>
                  <l>they'l ask and question if this same be true:</l>
                  <l>But God is witness of his misery,</l>
